# WOGWiiPak

Extracts files from World Of Goo (Wii) .pak packages, normally master.pak.

Do note that the first file in `master.pak` is also a pak, and the executable may also have paks on its own (one lookup pak linked to the actual data pak and the other for core files). Refer to the [format documentation](https://github.com/Nenkai/010GameTemplates/blob/main/2D%20Boy/World%20of%20Goo/PAK.bt).
